# NSTableView in Swift

There seem to be so many different ways to put a table view together and so many little features that need your attention. As such I'm trying to lay out some simple examples in this project to help me out when I need a table view in another project.

### Types of Table views
- Stock standard
- Cell Based
- Fancy View based
- Using Bindings (not overly interesting to me at this stage)

### Table View features
- Programatic selection control
- Filtering
- Search
- Animation

## Projects
- 01 BasicTableView, Stole the simplest table view example from Apple's NSTablePlayground example code.
- 02 BasicTableView Expanded, Same as above but adding some selection handling and the like.
